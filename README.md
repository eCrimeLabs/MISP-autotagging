# MISP autotagging
When working with MISP we have experienced that in some situations you need to put one or more local tags on events from various organizations typically based on that you trust data created by this and want to add additional automatization based on events from the source.

So we are please to announce a small tool that might assist organizations using  MISP to make the feature of automatically adding local tagging to events from specific organizations UUIDâ€™s.

The tools has the features of either adding or removing a set of predefined

## Configuration
rename the "config.py.template" to "config.py" and add in you MISP data and the organzation UUID and tags to work with, as the tool supports multiple tags you should be able to add as many as needed.

```
misp_url='https://<MISP-URL>'
misp_key='<MISP API KEY>'
misp_verifycert=True

dict_orgtags = {
    '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000': ['ecrimelabs:tag=1', 'ecrimelabs:tag=2'],
    '11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111': ['ecrimelabs:tag=3']
}
```

## Running the tool:

```
# venv/bin/python3 misp-autotagging.py -h
